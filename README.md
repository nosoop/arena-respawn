# Arena: Respawn

*Arena: Respawn* is a custom gamemode for [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com). Like Arena mode, *Arena: Respawn* has no respawn timers. Unlike Arena mode, players can be respawned mid-round if a teammate captures the central control point.

This simple rule change has led to a ton of interesting gameplay, as mentioned in the [Official Team Fortress 2 blog](http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=14487). If you'd like to try it out before installing, hop into a [server near you](http://steam.respawn.tf) and give it a spin.

## Use and installation

### Prerequisites
1. A dedicated server running Team Fortress 2. ([Installation guide](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dedicated_server_configuration))
2. MetaMod/SourceMod. ([Installation guide](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod_(simple)))

Once SourceMod is installed, you're good to go. **SourceMod is the only MetaMod requirement to run *Arena: Respawn*.**

This plugin will function on all official Arena maps and most community-made Arena maps. It contains the vanilla gamemode itself and nothing extra, although you can add some [extra stuff](#extra-stuff) if you want later. **[Download the plugin here](addons/sourcemod/plugins/arena_respawn.smx?raw=1)** (wgettable link) and drop it in your `addons/sourcemod/plugins` folder.

That's it! *Arena: Respawn* will automatically replace Arena mode. If you're interested in extra configuration or other cool stuff, read on.

### Configuration

*Arena: Respawn* comes with a bunch of configuration variables that you can set in your server's `server.cfg`. They're automatically set to sensible defaults, so you don't have to set these unless you want something other than the gamemode's default behavior.

#### `ars_force_arena`
**Default value:** `0`  
**Recommended tournament value:** `0`

If set to `1`, *Arena: Respawn* try to treat every map as an Arena map. This can be useful for testing out maps that haven't been converted to Arena yet, but is too buggy and silly for regular play.

#### `ars_cap_time`
**Default value:** `1.0`  
**Recommended tournament value:** `1.25`

Approximate amount of time (in seconds) that it takes for a point to be captured. This value is multiplied by the number of control points present on a map squared.

#### `ars_invuln_time`
**Default value:** `3.0`  
**Recommended tournament value:** `1.0`

How long to flash Uber on a newly respawned player.

#### `ars_first_blood_threshold`
**Default value:** `14`  
**Recommended tournament value:** `-1`

Number of active players required to enable First Blood (5 second critboost on the first kill in the round). Set to `0` to always enable First Blood or `-1` to always disable it.

#### `ars_lms_minicrits`  
**Default value:** `8.0`  
**Recommended tournament value:** `8.0`

How long (in seconds) a player death on the opposing team will grant the Last Man Standing a minicrit boost. Set to 8 seconds by default to match the minicrit boost time of the [Cleaner's Carbine](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Cleaner's_Carbine) and [Crit-a-Cola](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Crit-a-Cola).

## Extra stuff

### Custom map fixes

Not all Arena maps are entirely plug-and-play. Some custom maps have made design decisions based on the rules of standard Arena that just don't work in *Arena: Respawn*, such as the train arriving late in Ferrous, the spawn doors shutting in Hardhat, or the point exploding and killing everyone in Blackwood Valley.

Fortunately, the excellent [Stripper: Source](http://www.bailopan.net/stripper/) tool allows you to apply on-the-fly custom map fixes as the map loads. Install Stripper: Source and copy the [appropriate files](addons/stripper/maps) into your `addons/stripper/maps` directory.

**Note:** We have deliberately avoided working these special, per-map cases into the plugin (and will not accept merge requests that do so) for the following reasons:
- While all per-map problems can be eventually be solved by SourceMod, this often involves tearing out elements of the map to do so. The Stripper: Source configuration files leave the map alone and modify its *functionality* instead of playing butcher to the hard work of a mapper.
- Stripper syntax is closely related to entity keyvalue data, which most mappers are familiar with. This allows a mapper to write their own *Arena: Respawn* modifications without having to learn an extra tool in the process.
- Large amounts of special case code are not just bad practice, but downright nightmarish to maintain.

### Compiling the plugin yourself

You'll need [smlib](https://www.sourcemodplugins.org/smlib/) and the source files provided under `addons/sourcemod/scripting`. After installing SourceMod, change directory to `addons/sourcemod/scripting` and run `compile.sh arena_respawn.sp` or `compile.exe arena_respawn.sp`. This produces `arena_respawn.smx` in the `addons/sourcemod/scripting/compiled` directory.

If you create a modified version of *Arena: Respawn* to run on a public server, you must release the source of your modified code under the terms of the [AGPL](LICENSE.txt). This way, *Arena: Respawn* remains an open gamemode that all server owners can benefit from, instead of a select few keeping potentially new and interesting changes to themselves.

*Arena: Respawn* has always been intended to be a plugin open for the entire TF2 community to experiment with, so play nice and keep it that way.

### Arena class tweaks

The "IT'S ALIVE!" October update of *Arena: Respawn* introduced a series of class-specific mechanics, such as a global sentry damage reduction and tying Medics' heal rate to damage done. These are will be available in a separate, standalone plugin, as they can be applied to *Arena: Respawn* and standard Arena alike.
